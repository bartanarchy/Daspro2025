# Question from jobsheet 4 week 6

# Answer

1. theres no Test.txt because we didnt commit and push the file to our repository, thats why the test.txt didnt exist on our github
2. The function of Add, Commit, and Push in Git is that
   Add   : selects the changes you want to save
   Commit: records those changes as a new version in your local repository with a message
   Push  : uploads that version from your computer to GitHub so it can be stored or shared online
